Julie Norris is a Software Engineer who enjoys working on projects that make sense. I work in Python and Javascript and have at times used Pandas, Bootstrap, and a few other libraries. 

### Now
In June 2017 I attended Hackbright Academy's Software Engineering Fellowship program. At that time I created an app called Carpool! which was built with the idea of helping working mothers support their children by providing and finding rides to the plethora of extracurricular activities that ridiculously happen between 3:00 and 5:00 PM. Yes, developmentally appropriate. Not at all doable for those of us that work out of the home. Carpool! was never deployed but can be seen at this link:

#### And Then
Before 2017 I worked as an educator in positions that included Princpal of the Tenderloin Community School in San Francisco, Data Coach supporting 77 schools in SFUSD, and Instructional Coach. Before that I was a teacher, happily.
